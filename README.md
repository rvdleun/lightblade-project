# rvdleun-aframe-starter-kit
This is a starter kit that I frequently use when building new AFrame projects.

## Directory structure

### Public
Contains all public assets, like index.html and media files.

### src
Contains all javascript scripts

## Development
* Run `npm run dev`
* Open a web browser
* Go to localhost:8000
* Develop away! The browser will automatically refresh whenever a change is made.
    
## Build
* Run `npm run build`
* A ready-to-deploy project will be available in the dist directory.
